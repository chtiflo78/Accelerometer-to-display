# Accelerometer to display
Accelerometer MPU 6050 is connected to an Arduino that sends data to Python by I2C, Python program uses matplot to draw
1) MPU 6050 is connetced to the Arduino (quite straight forward, ref to picture)
2) The program called PMU6050_displau_by_matplotlib is by be compiled by the Arduino IDE
