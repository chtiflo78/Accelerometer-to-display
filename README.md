# Accelerometer to display by Florent Spriet (alias chtiflo78), April 2019
Arduino + Python
Accelerometer MPU 6050 is connected to an Arduino that sends data to Python by I2C, Python program uses matplot to draw
1) MPU 6050 is connected to the Arduino (quite straight forward, ref to picture)
2) The program called "MPU-6050_trans_to_PC."ino is by be compiled by the Arduino IDE and versed onto the Arduino
3) Compile the program "MPU6050 display by Matplotlib.py" and run it
4) Result is the picture "Displayed signal.jpg"
